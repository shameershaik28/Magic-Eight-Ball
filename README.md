Magic Eight Ball
In this project, we've built a Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript. The Magic Eight Ball is a classic fortune-telling toy that can answer any yes-or-no question with a random response. The user will be able to input a question, and our program will output a random fortune.
